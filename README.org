** The Program

MatrixClientProtocol.jl is intended as a library to allow developers to easily
write applications making use of the matrix network or otherwise integrate the
matrix network into their Julia application. The initial scope of development
will be as follows, but more functionality may be added over time as needed or
implemented by other contributors:

- login/logout of matrix account
- join/leave matrix rooms
- send basic text messages into matrix rooms

This package makes some architectural decisions that may differ from normal
expectations (in addition to its nature as a literate program of course).
Although the Julia package ecosystem does not currently have [[https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/][a sans-io]]
implementation of HTTP, such a model is the preference of the library author, so
string representations of request/response bodies and query parameters will be
made available whenever practical. Rather than representing the many JSON forms
of matrix as hash maps, this library defines a native Julia struct to
deserialize/serialize JSON to/from. These structs will be generated from the
swagger-compatible representation of the API.

*** Swagger processing

Rather than digging into the vagaries of the specification for the swagger
specification, we choose the pragmatic approach of looking at the swagger files
for matrix and figuring out a "good enough" interpretation of them. If some day
in the future, a swagger/OpenAPI package exists for Julia, we will switch this
over to using that, but for now, writing such a package is bit farther than I'd
like to yak-shave today.

[[https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc][The matrix documentation repository]] is cloned as a submodule of this repository
under the [[./matrix-doc][matrix-doc]] directory. Specifically, the swagger spec for the
client-server api is under [[./matrix-doc/api/client-server][matrix-doc/api/client-server]]. As a general example of
the structure of these swagger files, please reference [[./matrix-doc/api/client-server/sync.yaml][sync.yaml]].

What we ultimately want here is a macro that takes as input a path to a swagger
yaml file and creates a set of structs that can be used to encapsulate all
required values for requesting the endpoint and for processing the response.

We know the following about requests:

- tokens :: may be attached to any request as a query parameter or in a
            ~Authorization~ header as ~Bearer $access_token~ (not part of
            r0.3.0, but we'll include it anyway).
- Content-type :: for all requests will be ~application/json~
- ...

For this library, we will choose to pass access tokens in the header. So before
a request can be made to any endpoint, the following must be provided:

- ~Vector~ of ~Pair{String,String}~ of query parameters
- ~Vector~ of ~Pair~ of headers
- Body content encoded as a JSON ~String~.

**** Process swagger schema object

First we'll work towards generating a struct representing the body. Since a JSON
body is often nexted, as a simple first pass, this macro will be recursive,
defining structs for successive layers of the JSON body.

Before we can write the macros for generating request/response types, we'll need
some utility functions. The first turns the path from the swagger of the form
~"/_matrix/client/r0/login/"~ into an UpperCamelCase type name e.g. ~:Login~.
This function will return a symbol since it will be used as the type's name in
the macro. We need this so we can call the struct for representing the body of a
request to the aforementioned endpoint something like ~:LoginRequestBody~.

#+NAME: function-typename
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  """
      typename(path::AbstractString)::Symbol

  Returns a name for e.g. "/_matrix/client/r0/my/fun/path" like "MyFunPath".
  """
  function typename(path::AbstractString)::Symbol
      splitpath = split(path, "/"; keep=false)
      Symbol(join(titlecase.(splitpath[4:end]), ""))
  end
#+END_SRC

Then we write a nice simple testcase for this function to make sure all is
working right.

#+NAME: function-typename-test
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  @test MatrixSwagger.typename("/_matrix/client/r0/my/fun/path") == :MyFunPath
#+END_SRC

Now we need a function that will insert a new field into a type expression.
Basically given an expression like ~:(struct Foo end)~, we want to be able to
call a function to create ~struct Foo; a::A end~ if given ~a~ and ~A~.

#+NAME: function-insertfield
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  # Need convenience function to turn types into symbols/expressions for `insertfield!`
  "Inserts field `a` of type `T` into a type expression."
  function insertfield!(ex::Expr, a::Symbol, T::Union{Symbol,Expr})
      if ex.head == :type
          push!(ex.args[end].args, :($a::$T))
      else
          throw(ArgumentError("Can only add field to concrete type expression"))
      end#if
  end#function
#+END_SRC

We should test that a struct has the fieldnames we'd expect after modifying its
expression with this function.

#+NAME: function-insertfield-test
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  @testset "insertfield!" begin
      e = :(struct Foo; a::String end)
      MatrixSwagger.insertfield!(e, :b, :Int64)
      @test all(e.args[end].args[end-1:end] .== [:(a::String), :(b::Int64)])
      MatrixSwagger.insertfield!(e, :c, :(Vector{Int64}))
      @test all(e.args[end].args[end-2:end] .==
                [:(a::String), :(b::Int64), :(c::Vector{Int64})])
  end
#+END_SRC

To feed into this function, we need to be able to map from the types defined in
the JSON schema in the swagger to real concrete Julia types. Then we will have
all the information we need to parse the nested JSON objects into a set of
nested Julia types.

#+NAME: function-juliatype
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  """
      juliatype(topleveltype::String[, nestedtypes...])::Type

  Return corresponding Julia type for a swagger type string.

  Throws ArgumentError for unknown types.
  """
  function juliatype(s::AbstractString, args...)::Union{Symbol,Expr}
      if s == "string"
          :String
      elseif s == "array" && !isempty(args)
          :(Vector{$(juliatype(args...))})
      elseif s == "object"
          :(Dict{String,Any})
      elseif s == "boolean"
          :Bool
      elseif s == "file"
          :IOBuffer
      elseif s == "integer"
          :Int64
      elseif s == "number"
          :Float64
      else
          throw(ArgumentError("No known corresponding Julia type"))
      end#if
  end#function
#+END_SRC

We should test that this handles both unnested and nested cases.

#+NAME: function-juliatype-test
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  @testset "juliatype" begin
      @test MatrixSwagger.juliatype("boolean") == :Bool
      @test MatrixSwagger.juliatype("array", "object") == :(Vector{Dict{String,Any}})
  end
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: macro-process-schema
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia
  macro process_schema(path::AbstractString, d::Dict)
      :(struct $path
        end)
  end

#+END_SRC

Now this should all be joined together in ~src~ and in ~test~.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia :tangle src/MatrixSwagger.jl :noweb yes
  module MatrixSwagger

  <<function-typename>>

  <<function-insertfield>>

  <<function-juliatype>>

  end#module
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia :tangle test/MatrixSwagger.jl :noweb yes
  using MatrixClientProtocol: MatrixSwagger

  @testset "Utils" begin
      <<function-typename-test>>
      <<function-insertfield-test>>
      <<function-juliatype-test>>
  end
#+END_SRC

*** MatrixClientProtocol.jl

This file ties all of the previous work together, making modules available to
other modules, etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia :tangle src/MatrixClientProtocol.jl
  module MatrixClientProtocol

  include("MatrixSwagger.jl")

  end#module
#+END_SRC

This file runs all the tests written in other files.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia :tangle test/runtests.jl
  using Base.Test

  println("Starting tests...")

  @testset "Matrix Swagger" begin include("MatrixSwagger.jl") end
#+END_SRC
*** REQUIRE

This program is written using Julia v0.6 although v0.7 and stable v1.0 are on
the near horizon. In the absence of an [[https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2][h2]]-style HTTP library for Julia, it uses
the HTTP.jl library for making requests to a matrix server and receiving
responses. JSON.jl is used for deserializing JSON from matrix server responses,
and for creating Julia structs from the swagger spec.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-julia :tangle REQUIRE :eval never
  julia 0.6
  HTTP 0.4.3
  JSON 0.17.0
#+END_SRC
