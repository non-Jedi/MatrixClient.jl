** The Program

MatrixProtocolClient.jl is intended as a library to allow developers to easily
write applications making use of the matrix network or otherwise integrate the
matrix network into their Julia application. The initial scope of development
will be as follows, but more functionality may be added over time as needed or
implemented by other contributors:

- login/logout of matrix account
- join/leave matrix rooms
- send basic text messages into matrix rooms

This package makes some architectural decisions that may differ from normal
expectations (in addition to its nature as a literate program of course).
Although the Julia package ecosystem does not currently have [[https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/][a sans-io]]
implementation of HTTP, such a model is the preference of the library author, so
string representations of request/response bodies and query parameters will be
made available whenever practical. Rather than representing the many JSON forms
of matrix as hash maps, this library defines a native Julia struct to
deserialize/serialize JSON to/from. These structs will be generated from the
swagger-compatible representation of the API.

*** HTTP Endpoints

Here we'll create types and functions to make access of the matrix HTTP apis
convenient. First, we should make it possible to login.

**** General setup

First of all, login endpoints along with many parts of matrix use "types" with
Java-style namespaces. For login, we have ~m.login.password~ for example. We'll
represent these with a simple parametric type with no fields where the parameter
will be a tuple of the form ~(:m, :login, :password)~. This will allow
specialization and dispatching on these types when they appear.

For convenience, we'll also define abstract types for grouping processed
requests and responses from the matrix server. In general, functions calling
matrix api endpoints should accept ~Endpoint~ type arguments and return
~Response~.

#+NAME: matrix-type
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  abstract type Endpoint{M} end

  abstract type Response{E <: Endpoint} end
#+END_SRC

Even though we're only designing the system for logging in now, we can see that
we'll need to be able to send a wide variety of HTTP requests. So let's define a
basic fallback function for that purpose.

#+NAME: matrix-request
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  import HTTP

  export request

  """
      request(::Endpoint)::Response

  Calls a matrix endpoint and returns a processed response.
  """
  function request(req::T)::Response{T} where {T <: Endpoint}
      res = HTTP.request(method(req), url(req), headers(req), body(req))
      # We expect different response formats depending on details of request
      process_response(req, res)
  end#function
#+END_SRC

This begins to show us what methods need an implementation for all
~Endpoint~ types, defining the interface: 

- ~method~
- ~url~ or both ~path~ and ~query~
- ~headers~ (defaults to only including the Authorization header)
- ~body~ (defaults empty)
- ~process_response~
- ~response_type~ which will be shown later

For the first, this is why we made ~Endpoint~ parametric. We define
~method~ as follows.

#+NAME: method
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  function method(req::Endpoint{M})::AbstractString where {M}
      if M in (:GET, :HEAD, :POST, :PUT, :DELETE, :TRACE, :OPTIONS, :CONNECT, :PATCH)
          string(M)
      else
          throw(DomainError(M, "Not a valid HTTP method."))
      end#if
  end#function
#+END_SRC

For ~url~, we will assume that ~Endpoint~ has a ~host~ field. We also must
define ~path~ and ~query~ methods. Zero query params will be set as the default
case, but there is no sane default for ~path~.

#+NAME: url
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  import HTTP.URIs: URI

  url(req::Endpoint)::URI =
      URI(; scheme="https", host=req.host, path=path(req), query=query(req))
  query(::Endpoint) = ""
#+END_SRC

Specific headers may be needed on each endpoint, but the most common header
needed by matrix is the ~Authorization~ header for transmitting the user's
access token. ~Endpoint~ types will have to opt out of having this token
sent in the headers.

#+NAME: headers
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  headers(req::Endpoint) = defaultheaders(req)
  defaultheaders(req::Endpoint) = ["Authorization" => "Bearer " * token(req)]
  token(req::Endpoint) = req.token
#+END_SRC

~body(req)~ should default to empty since =GET= request shouldn't have bodies.

#+NAME: body
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  body(::Endpoint) = Vector{UInt8}()
#+END_SRC

The most complicated of these methods is ~process_response~. This will be
defined independently for each endpoint and method.

For utility we define the following constants and utility functions for using
them.

#+NAME: http-consts
#+begin_src julia
  const base_path = ["/_matrix", "client", "r0"]
  extend_path(extpath::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString}) =
      join(vcat(base_path, extpath), "/")
#+end_src

**** Login

First we define the types for ~GET~ and ~POST~ requests to the login endpoint.

#+NAME: login-request
#+begin_src julia
  struct GetLogin <: Endpoint{:GET}
      host::String
  end

  headers(::GetLogin) = Pair{String,String}[]
  path(::GetLogin) = extend_path(["login"])
#+end_src

#+NAME: login-request-test
#+begin_src julia
  import MatrixProtocolClient: MatrixHTTP

  @testset "get login" begin
      let MH = MatrixHTTP, req = MH.GetLogin("example.com"), u = MH.url(req)
          @test MH.method(req) == "GET"
          @test u.host == "example.com"
          @test u.path == "/_matrix/client/r0/login"
          @test u.scheme == "https"
          @test isempty(u.query)
          @test isempty(MH.headers(req))
          @test isempty(MH.body(req))
      end#let
  end#testset

#+end_src

The more difficult bit is processing this response. For this we need
to define a struct with all the potential information from the
response.

#+NAME: login-request-process
#+begin_src julia
  struct GetLoginResponse{S <: AbstractString} <: Response{GetLogin}
	  flows::Vector{S}
  end#struct

  import LazyJSON
  const LJ = LazyJSON

  function process_response(endpoint::GetLogin, resp::HTTP.Response)
	  GetLoginResponse([i.type for i in LJ.value(String(resp.body)).flows])
  end#function
#+end_src

#+NAME: login-request-process-test
#+begin_src julia
  import MatrixProtocolClient: MatrixHTTP
  const MH = MatrixHTTP
  import HTTP: Response

  @testset "get login process" begin
	  let resp = Response(200; body=
		  Vector{UInt8}("{\"flows\": [{\"type\": \"m.login.password\"}]}")),
		  glr = MH.process_response(MH.GetLogin("example.com"), resp)
		  @test length(glr.flows) == 1
		  @test glr.flows[1] == "m.login.password"
	  end#let
  end#testset
#+end_src
